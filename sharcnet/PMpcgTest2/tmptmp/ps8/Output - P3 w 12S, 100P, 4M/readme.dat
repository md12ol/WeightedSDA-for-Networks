The file descriptions are as follows: 
best.lint -> the best fitness and it's associated data for each run
difc.dat -> the diffusion characters of the best graph for each run
run##.dat -> population statistics for each run
patient0.dat -> record of patient zeros
initGraph.dat -> the initial power law clustering graph
